=== Adding nodes to the {partner-product-short-name} cluster

By default, your Quick Start deployment starts with a single {partner-product-short-name} node (Auto Scaling group of `min=1` and `max=1`). When you're ready to add nodes to your cluster, perform the following steps:

.	Sign in to the AWS Management Console, use the Region selector in the navigation bar to choose the AWS Region for your deployment, and open the AWS CloudFormation console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/.
.	Choose the {partner-product-short-name} stack. From the *Actions* list, choose *Update Stack*.
.	On the *Select Template* page, leave *Use current template* selected, and then choose *Next*.
.	On the *Specify Details* page, in the *{partner-product-short-name} Setup* section of *Parameters*, enter the number of cluster nodes in *Minimum number of cluster nodes* and *Maximum number of cluster nodes*, and then click through to update the stack. This step sets a static number of nodes in your cluster.
. After the stack finishes updating, verify the number of nodes in your {partner-product-short-name} cluster. Choose *Clustering* again from the administration console sidebar. The following example shows a cluster that is scaled up to three instances.
