== Configuring {partner-product-short-name}

The following procedure helps you set up your new {partner-product-short-name} deployment.

. Choose the URL that is displayed in the *Outputs* tab of the AWS CloudFormation stack to go to the {partner-product-name-short} configuration page.
+
IMPORTANT: If you get an https://confluence.atlassian.com/kb/network-and-connectivity-troubleshooting-guide-720405335.html[HTTP Error 503] response when you access the URL, it means that {partner-product-name-short} is still loading. This is expected, and you should wait a couple of minutes before trying again.
. On the *Licensing and Settings* page, enter a title for your Bitbucket deployment. Leave the base URL unchanged, and choose the appropriate licensing option. If you don’t have a valid license for Bitbucket Data Center, sign up for an evaluation license.

. To set up Bitbucket Data Center, you need to create an Administrator account and password. The Administrator account has full access to all data in Bitbucket, so we highly recommend that you choose a strong password for this account. Enter your Administrator’s user details in the *Administrator account setup screen*, and choose *Go to Bitbucket*.

Your {partner-product-name} deployment is now in a state where you can add nodes that will automatically cluster with your existing node.

=== Adding nodes to the {partner-product-short-name} cluster

By default, your Quick Start deployment starts with a single {partner-product-short-name} node (Auto Scaling group of `min=1` and `max=1`). When you're ready to add nodes to your cluster, perform the following steps:

.	Sign in to the AWS Management Console, use the Region selector in the navigation bar to choose the AWS Region for your deployment, and open the AWS CloudFormation console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/.
.	Choose the {partner-product-short-name} stack. From the *Actions* list, choose *Update Stack*.
.	On the *Select Template* page, leave *Use current template* selected, and then choose *Next*.
.	On the *Specify Details* page, in the *{partner-product-short-name} Setup* section of *Parameters*, enter the number of cluster nodes in *Minimum number of cluster nodes* and *Maximum number of cluster nodes*, and then click through to update the stack. This step sets a static number of nodes in your cluster.
. After the stack finishes updating, verify the number of nodes in your {partner-product-short-name} cluster. Choose *Clustering* again from the administration console sidebar. The following example shows a cluster that is scaled up to three instances.

NOTE: You can also migrate Bitbucket data from an existing deployment to this one. For more information, see the https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/moving-from-server-to-data-center-953127136.html#MovingfromServertoDataCenter-Migrationguides[migration guides] on the Atlassian website.
